I will be taking notes while taking this course. This will be cumulative so there will be an update every video.
I am not taking notes of everything. Most stuff I may know already. I will be taking notes on stuff I would like to come back to.
I find it more difficult to create new notes.txt file in each section. I can easily come back to this file and search anything.
