# range(7)  # gives you integers from 0 thru 6

# range(1, 8)  # gives you integers from 1 to 7

# range(
#     1, 10, 2
# )  # will give you odd numbers from 1 to 10. the 3rd number is the interveal. generate numbers from 1 to 10 (not including 10) and skipping two numbers

# range(7, 0, -1)  # you will get the numbers 7 to 1
